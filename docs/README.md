# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This folder contains our living guides, templates, and playbooks for running cross-functional projects consistently and safely.

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, iterative lifecycle: Initiation (one‑pager to validate the problem, goals, stakeholders, and success metrics), Planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, estimates, Definition of Done, and release mapping), Execution & Tracking (small, testable increments tracked on a project board with PR/CI conventions), Release & Deployment (pre-release checks, smoke tests, and rollback plans), and Close & Retrospective (capture learnings and convert them into action items). We emphasize iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decision making.

Key workflows include using a project board with columns (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), a Pull Request workflow that favors small PRs and passing CI, and a risk register that is updated weekly and escalated through defined paths. Core roles (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders) each have defined responsibilities to ensure clear ownership of milestones, escalations, and communication.

Communication and quality assurance are built into our cadence: daily standups, regular delivery syncs, sprint demos, weekly PM+PdM alignment, monthly stakeholder updates, and incident comms. QA expectations include unit and integration tests, security scanning in CI, manual QA as needed, and smoke tests for pre/post‑deploy verification. Retrospectives convert learnings into small, tracked action items to continuously improve the process.
